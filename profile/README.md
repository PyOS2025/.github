##  About PyOS

PyOS is an ambitious long-term project to build a complete, bootable operating system using Python and its ecosystem. Our goal is to create an OS that's not just functional, but also easily extensible, community-driven, and educational – with full release planned for 2027.



###  Key Highlights
- **Python-Powered**: Entirely written in Python 3.x
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and customize
- **Learning-Friendly**: Great for understanding OS internals
- **Community-Driven**: Open-source and collaborative


### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Interest in OS development
- Basic understanding of low-level programming (helpful but not required)
