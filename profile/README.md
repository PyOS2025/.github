## About PyOS

PyOS is an ambitious **long-term project** to build a complete, bootable operating system using Python and its ecosystem. This is not a quick hack or prototype – we're building a full-fledged operating system from the ground up, with the first stable release planned for **2027**.

Imagine an operating system where the kernel is written in Python, where you can install packages with pip, and where the entire system is as hackable as your favorite script. PyOS aims to bridge the gap between high-level programming and low-level systems, making OS development accessible to everyone!



### Mission
To democratize operating system development by leveraging Python's simplicity and power, creating a platform that's both powerful and approachable for developers, students, and enthusiasts worldwide.



### Key Highlights
- **Python-Powered**: Entirely written in Python 3.x
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and customize
- **Community-Driven**: Open-source and collaborative
- **High Performance**: Optimized for modern hardware
- **Secure by Design**: Built with security best practices

### Features
- **Bootable Kernel**: A Python-based kernel that can boot independently
- **Package Manager**: Install and manage software with Python packages
- **File System Support**: Compatible with existing file systems
- **Networking Stack**: Full TCP/IP implementation
- **Device Drivers**: Support for common hardware peripherals
- **Shell Environment**: Command-line interface with Python scripting
- **Application Framework**: Build and run Python applications natively

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Interest in OS development
- Basic understanding of low-level programming (helpful but not required)
- A development environment (Linux/Mac/Windows)

### Getting Started
We're in the early development phase, so the codebase is evolving rapidly. For now, you can:

1. **Follow our progress** on GitHub and social media
2. **Join discussions** to share ideas and feedback
3. **Contribute** once we have initial code repositories set up

*Full development environment and setup instructions will be available as we progress. Stay tuned for updates in 2025!*

## 2027 Vision
By 2027, PyOS will be:
- A fully bootable, Python-powered operating system
- A platform for millions of Python applications
- An educational tool for learning OS development
- A community-driven project that revolutionizes computing
